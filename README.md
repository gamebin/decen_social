# decentralized social service - Linking
'Linking' is a kind of social service like facebook or twitter. 
But it's different from those services in view of service data authority.

### own your data 
Imagine that the facebook or twitter shut-down. You can not get your data !!
Even though fortunately you downloaded your data, you can not publish it on the web. 
Every social services use their own standard to save, to publish your data. It's impposible to be interoperable between services.
Linking uses W3C social standard to solve those problems. 
You can move your data whenever you want by using Linking. 

### connectivity and openness
Every social services which use social standard can be interoperable. 

### W3C standards
